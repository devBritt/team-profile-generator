### Lessons
---
The Team Profile Generator was definitely the most involved challenge to date. This project required the use of every concept and technique I've learned so far for both frontend and backend development. Using Node.js and npm, I was able to add the Inquirer package to easily prompt users for information. It also allowed me to install Jest to run tests throughout the development process.  

In addition to reinforcing skills learned during prior modules, I also was able to practice new concepts like using Promises and arrow functions. I decided to spend some time researching more informative READMEs and learned how to add code snippets and nest images within links in markdown.
